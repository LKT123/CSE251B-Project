# CSE 251B 2025 Spring Course Project

## 1. Project Description: Trajectory Prediction Challenge
This competition focuses on developing accurate motion forecasting models using the Argoverse 2 Motion Forecasting Dataset. Participants will predict future trajectories of diverse agents (vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, etc.) in complex, real-world driving scenarios.

We use a modified version of the Argoverse 2 dataset which provides 11-second scenarios with 2D bird's-eye-view data (centroid and heading) sampled at 10Hz. This dataset is designed to challenge models with long-range predictions, diverse agent behaviors, complex social interactions, and rare, critical events.

The goal is to develop models that accurately predict future trajectories, contributing to the advancement of safe and reliable autonomous driving systems. We aim to give you a taste of what is like to do machine learning IRL. Plus, let's be real, who doesn't want to say they taught a computer to see the future?
